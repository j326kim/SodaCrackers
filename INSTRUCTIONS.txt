Open solutionscript.m in matlab and at the top there is a variable called TestType.

TestType takes in the variable Oscillation or PullBack which determines which test is run.

PullBack will keep on applying a ramp force until the max tension or compression is reached within a member.

Oscillation will pull the bow back to a force specified in the variable F_End (Newtons) and then release the force.
The oscillation of the bow and the string will be displayed in the animation. The total time of the test for Oscillation
can be adjusted using the variable maxTime(milliseconds).
